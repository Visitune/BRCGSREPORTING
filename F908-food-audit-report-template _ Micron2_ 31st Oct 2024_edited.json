The policy is communicated to all staff e.g. posted on staff noticeboards and included in the staff induction programme.\n\nThere is also a defined plan for the development and continual improvement of the food safety and quality culture, reference, yyyy-mm-dd. The plan is based on the key pillars of: People, Process, Purpose and Proactivity and demonstrated the site’s shared attitudes, values, ethos and beliefs relating to the importance of product safety and quality, which was led be leadership behaviours and management practices (and complied with BRCGS Position Statement F837).\nThe plan (as discussed with ROLE) included defined improvement activities for all site sections impacting food safety e.g. [customise as required, include timescales]\ncommunication strategies to all levels\nuse of culture surveys to benchmark the level of the ‘culture’ at the site and staff values\nstaff rewards and recognition programme\nstaff feedback mechanisms\ntraining reviews e.g. updating refresher training programmes, delivery of safety culture presentations\neffectiveness review of FSC activities undertaken\ndoes the plan cover all departments onsite?\nThe above action plan was maintained with an annual or other more frequent review, last on yyyy-mm-dd.\n\nMeasurable objectives to maintain and improve food safety, legality, authenticity and quality were documented, monitored and regularly reviewed by senior management quarterly or other more frequent, last on yyyy-mm-dd and were included as part of the annual management review agenda. Objectives included e.g. [customise as required, include timescales]\nreview effectiveness of food safety and quality culture plan\nProduction staff interviewed during the audit were able to demonstrate awareness of these policies, targets and objectives.\n\nA management review meeting is held annually or other more frequent, most recently on yyyy-mm-dd and was attended by all available Senior Management (e.g. ROLES). All required agenda items as required by the Standard were discussed e.g. [customise as required]\nthe improvement objectives\nreviews of internal or supplier audits\nlevel of complaints\nsafety or quality incidents and investigations\nresourcing\nWhenever an objective or action would not be met, an investigation would be undertaken, the reason determined, and a revised objective or target would be set. Outputs from the management review meeting included future planned improvements and targets, which are communicated by team briefings and/or assignment of actions to relevant personnel. Additional monthly or other more frequent senior management meetings are scheduled to enable recent food safety, authenticity, legality or quality issues to be addressed, most recently on yyyy-mm-dd.\n\nA confidential reporting system for staff has been established to enable reporting and recording of concerns relating to food safety, authenticity, legality and quality directly to senior management. The reporting mechanism consisted of [details] and was clearly communicated to staff [e.g. when / how].\n\nBased on the evidence reviewed during this audit, the company appeared to provide sufficient human and financial resources to produce safe, authentic, legal food products in compliance with the Standard.\n\nSite management are aware of relevant legislative changes, scientific developments, codes of practice and emerging authenticity risks via: [customise as required]\nindustry specific memberships (Campden BRI)\nlocal EHO / TSO\nexternal consultant\nFSA (alerts)\nweb searches\ntrade magazine subscriptions\nraw material suppliers and customers\n\nThe site holds a genuine copy of BRCGS Food Standard Issue 9 as a hard or electronic copy and they are aware of recent changes published on the BRCGS website. This announced or unannounced audit complied with the audit window requirements for recertification (re-audit date was yyyy-mm-dd), and the auditor was in production within 30 minutes of arriving on site [required for unannounced audits]. The audit opening and closing meetings were supported by senior management e.g. [roles present, include deputies if needed]. The XX major and XX minor non-conformances raised at the previous BRCGS audit have been resolved satisfactorily with action plans implemented and the root causes addressed. The site uses or does not currently use the BRCGS Logo[; usage and certification status were according to the BRCGS protocol (Part III Section 6.7 of the Standard)].\nThe site is registered as a food business operator by relevant authorities, [if required by legislation], with the latest local EHO site inspection on yyyy-mm-dd.\n\nA current comprehensive organisational structure indicating job functions and lines of communication had been established and was demonstrated by an organogram (ref, yyyy-mm-dd).\nThe management team includes [customise roles e.g. CEO, MD, Operations Manager / Director, Technical Director / Manager, QA Manager, Chief Engineering Manager, HR Manager, NPD Manager]. Responsibilities are defined in job descriptions, e.g. role profiles, yyyy-mm-dd.\nDeputies in the absence of the responsible person are documented e.g. Technical Manager by QA Supervisor.\n\nDocumented work instructions are in place and are accessible to the relevant personnel e.g. [customise with evidence seen e.g. recipes and process specifications, references, yyyy-mm-dd]. Staff interviewed were able to demonstrate that work is carried out in accordance with instructions.\n\nStaff are aware of the need to report unsafe or out-of-specification product, equipment, packaging or raw material to a designated manager [; any recent reporting and how / when resolved].\n\nThe company do or do not currently make use of a food safety consultant to assist with the requirements of the standard[; however, the responsibility for management of the food safety systems remains with the company management].",

Control measures were used to reduce risks; where these control measures are part of a prerequisite programme they have been validated.\n\nThe CCP decision tree had been used and X CCPs were identified:\nCCP1: control measure; measurable critical limits; monitoring and recording frequency; and corrective action (based on SOP ref and recorded on ref).\nCCP2: control measure; measurable critical limits; monitoring and recording frequency; and corrective action.\nCCPx: Metal detection; detection limits 2.5mm Fe, 3.0mm non-Fe and 4.0mm SS; monitored at start and end of shift and hourly in between (record reference); non-compliant product quarantined and situation investigated.\n\nCritical limits for the CCPs have been validated by [temperature datalogger process profile and final product analyses].\n\n[If new HACCP – detail how HACCP has been validated].\nVerification of the HACCP system was provided by [customise list: internal audits e.g. monthly metal detection challenge of operators by QA Team (e.g. on yyyy-mm-dd), by verification of operator CCP monitoring records (by Technical Manager), review of customer complaints and absence of product withdrawals or product recalls].\n\nThe HACCP plan and prerequisite programmes are reviewed by the HACCP Team annually or prior to any changes which may impact food safety, most recently on yyyy-mm-dd.
